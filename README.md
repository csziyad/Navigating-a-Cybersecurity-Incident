## Project: Navigating a Cybersecurity Incident

### Overview:
In this project, I  apply the skills I acquired in this course to navigate a potential cyber incident. I identify the type of threat actor involved and the potential motivation behind the attack. Based on various clues provided, I  conduct scans to discover and test vulnerabilities that could lead to a successful attack. Then I assess risk levels associated with the findings and propose a remediation plan. I leverage the provided incident response plan to navigate the potential breach and make recommendations for improvements to the plan.
